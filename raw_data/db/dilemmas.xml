But Liu Yan's son, Liu Zhang, intends to inherit his father's position, and has the means to enforce his claim.\n\nYour duty as a subject should compel you to support Hu Mao. But this would draw you into conflict with Liu Zhang, a growing power.\n\nAlternatively, you ask Hu Mao to report to you directly as the price of your aid. Doing so would extend your sphere of influence, but would alienate both Liu Zhang and the court.</localised_description>
